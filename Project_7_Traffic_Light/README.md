The goal of this project is to:
 - **Summary:** Build a classification pipeline that takes in an image of a traffic and outputs a label that classifies the image as red, green or yello light. I achieved a accuracy of 97.6%, 7 misclassified images out of 297 total images.
 - **Keywords:** Computer Vision, Machine Learning
