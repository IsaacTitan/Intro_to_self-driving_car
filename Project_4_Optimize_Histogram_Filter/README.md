# Project 4 Optimize Histogram Filter

The goal of this project is to:
 - **Summary:** Optimize C++ code, to get the histogram filter code to run faster. I was able to reduce the execution time from 350ms to only 2ms, using several optimized methodes. 
 - **Keywords:** C++, Code Optimization
 - **How to Start:**
	 cd optimized_code
	 g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp blur_improved.cpp initialize_beliefs_improved.cpp move_improved.cpp normalize_improved.cpp print.cpp sense_improved.cpp zeros_improved.cpp
	 ./a.out
